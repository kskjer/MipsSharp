# MipsSharp
This software works with N64 ROMs and binaries. It is capable of the following:

 - Patching assembly code into ROMs
 - Detection of EUC-JP strings in a supplied file
 - File extraction from Zelda 64 ROMs
 - Function signature creation and identification
 - Zelda 64 overlay disassembly
 
This is a work in progress. See the [Getting started](https://github.com/kskjer/MipsSharp/wiki/Getting-started) page on the wiki for more info.
